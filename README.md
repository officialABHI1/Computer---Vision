# Computer---Vision

Driver drowsiness detection is a beta prototype built using Dlib and OpenCV with Python as the backend language.

The project includes direct working with the 68 facial landmark detector and also the face detector of the Dlib library. The 68 facial landmark detector is a robustly trained efficient detector which detects the points on the human face using which we determine whether the eyes are open or they are closed.
